# AGENTS.md

This file guides coding agents (Claude Code and compatible tools) working in this
repository. It is also surfaced as `CLAUDE.md` via a symlink, so both names resolve
to this single source.

## What this is

Agent-driven payments on Stellar. A user signs an AP2 **IntentMandate**; an AI
agent pays for a 402-gated resource via **x402**; the Soroban **MandateRegistry**
contract enforces scope, budget, expiry, and replay at consume time. A compromised
agent or SDK cannot exceed the mandate.

**The core invariant:** money moves only through `MandateRegistry.execute_payment`,
which validates-and-consumes the mandate atomically *before* it transfers. The user
approves the SEP-41 allowance for the **contract**, never for the agent or SDK. The SDK
is untrusted; the contract is the source of truth. When changing anything, preserve
this: never let a spend path bypass `execute_payment`, and never move the allowance
or enforcement into TypeScript.

## Commands

This is an npm workspaces monorepo (`packages/*`, `apps/*`) plus a Rust/Soroban
contract that is **not** part of the npm workspace.

- `npm run verify` — the local CI-equivalent gate; **run this before every push.**
  Runs rustfmt, clippy (`-D warnings`), `cargo test`, then a *clean* workspace
  build + `npm test`. Mirrors `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Wired as a git pre-push
  hook via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (one-time, per clone).
- `npm run build` — builds `@reapp-sdk/stellar` first (the others depend on it),
  then all workspaces.
- `npm test` — runs every workspace's tests.
- `npm run typecheck` — root `tsc` (project references).

Contract (run inside `contracts/mandate-registry/`):
- `cargo test` — full suite incl. the §10 negative suite (19 tests + snapshots).
- `cargo test <name>` — a single test, e.g. `cargo test overspend_cumulative_rejected`.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.

SDK / app tests use the Node test runner via tsx, e.g.
`node --import tsx --test packages/sdk/src/x402.test.ts`.

On-chain scripts (need a funded testnet burner in `.env` — copy `.env.example`):
- `npm run demo` — the "aha": happy path + rogue rejections (overspend, replay,
  pay-after-revoke) on testnet.
- `npm run e2e:x402` — full x402 round-trip: ResearchAgent buys from the 402-gated
  merchant via `agent.fetch`; three settle on-chain, the fourth is budget-rejected.
- `npm run e2e:testnet`, `npm run e2e:sdk` — lower-level on-chain e2e.
- `npm run gatecheck` — independent on-chain mandate gatecheck tool.
- `npm run deploy:testnet` — deploy the contract; fill the resulting ids into `.env`.
- `npm run keys:derive-freighter` — scan BIP39 indexes to match a Freighter pubkey
  (seed typed at runtime, never stored).

## Architecture

Data/trust flow: **user** signs a mandate → SDK registers it + approves the
allowance *for the contract* → **agent** calls `execute_payment` → contract
validates+consumes, then does the SEP-41 `transfer_from(user → merchant)`.

### `contracts/mandate-registry/` — Rust / soroban-sdk (the enforcement layer)
The entire protocol; small by design (small interface = reviewable). Modules have a
strictly one-way dependency graph (no cycles), documented at the top of `src/lib.rs`:
`lib → {registry, payment} → storage → mandate/error`, with `events` as a leaf.
- `lib.rs` — contract entry points only (thin dispatch, no logic).
- `storage.rs` — the **only** module that touches `env.storage`; `DataKey` + TTL.
- `registry.rs` — `register_mandate` / `revoke_mandate` (allowance funding model).
- `payment.rs` — `validate_mandate` (read-only preflight) + `execute_payment` (the
  one money path: `require_auth(agent)` → replay guard on `expected_seq` → re-validate
  → advance `spent`+`seq` → transfer; reverts on any failure).
- `mandate.rs` (pure data), `error.rs` (typed errors), `events.rs`.
- `test.rs` + `test_snapshots/` — the negative suite (§10), which CI runs from
  commit one. `reentry_probe.rs` is a reentrancy guard test.

### `packages/stellar/` — `@reapp-sdk/stellar` (typed Soroban layer)
Network config (`TESTNET`), the generated/typed `registryClient` contract bindings,
SEP-41 `token` helpers, and `keypairSigner`. Built first; everything else depends on it.

### `packages/sdk/` — `@reapp-sdk/core` (thin, untrusted client)
The under-10-line flow (`reapp.createIntentMandate` → `registerMandate` →
`approveBudget` → `agent()` → `agent.pay`/`agent.fetch`). Key files:
- `index.ts` — `reapp` facade + the `Agent` class. `createIntentMandate` defines the
  **canonical hash** (mandate id) by a fixed JSON field order — *changing that order
  changes every id*; keep it stable. `toStroops` is strict-by-design money parsing
  (rejects anything that could wrap to a wrong on-chain i128).
- `x402.ts` — the **only** place that knows the HTTP shape of the 402 challenge and
  the `X-PAYMENT` settlement-proof header. Isolated so the moving x402 v0.2/v0.3 wire
  format can change without touching the contract or `Agent.pay`. The proof is a
  *settlement* proof (payment already happened on-chain); the merchant re-verifies
  the txHash on-chain — the header is never trusted on its own.

### `apps/`
- `fulfillment-agent/` — reference 402-gated merchant; verifies payment on-chain
  before serving.
- `consumer-agent/` — reference ResearchAgent; buys sources via `agent.fetch`, budget
  enforced on-chain.

## Conventions

- **Security boundary discipline:** SDK-side checks (e.g. `Agent.fetch` comparing the
  402's `payTo` to the mandate merchant) are fail-fast convenience only. The real
  boundary is always the contract + the merchant's on-chain verification. Don't
  present an SDK check as the enforcement.
- The contract is gatechecked and live on testnet; treat its interface as a published
  contract. The negative/§10 suite is not optional and must stay green from commit one.
- `security/` holds the contract, SDK, and x402 gatecheck records; the release docs
  `docs/mandate-registry-contract.md`, `docs/reapp-sdk-npm.md`, and `docs/x402-roundtrip.md`
  document each shipped step. Update them when the matching surface changes.
- Testnet only in this repo: hot burner keys, never reused on mainnet, never committed.
